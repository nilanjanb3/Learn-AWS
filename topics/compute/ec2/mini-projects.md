## EC2 Mini Projects
Here are categorized mini-projects for AWS EC2, focusing on SAA C03 topics, integration with other AWS services, and current market demands:

### **Beginner Level**
1. **Basic EC2 Instance Setup & SSH Access**
   - Launch an EC2 instance, configure security groups, and connect via SSH. Explore key-pair management and basic instance operations.
   
2. **EC2 with Elastic IP and Security Groups**
   - Assign and manage an Elastic IP, set up and configure Security Groups, and test external connectivity.
   
3. **EC2 Auto-Recovery with CloudWatch Alarms**
   - Configure a CloudWatch alarm to trigger EC2 instance recovery when it becomes unreachable.

4. **EC2 Storage Management with EBS**
   - Attach and manage Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes with EC2 instances, exploring snapshot creation and resizing.

### **Intermediate Level**
5. **Auto Scaling EC2 Instances with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
   - Implement auto-scaling with load balancing to handle dynamic traffic loads. Include monitoring and scaling policies for real-time traffic changes.
   
6. **EC2 Launch Templates and Spot Instances for Cost Optimization**
   - Create EC2 Launch Templates for reproducible instance configuration, and explore integrating Spot Instances to reduce costs.

7. **EC2 Instance Role with S3 Integration**
   - Configure an EC2 instance to interact with an S3 bucket using IAM roles. Explore permissions and security management between services.

8. **EC2 Monitoring with CloudWatch & CloudWatch Logs**
   - Monitor EC2 performance with custom metrics, set up CloudWatch Alarms, and enable logging for troubleshooting purposes.

9. **EC2 with Elastic File System (EFS)**
   - Deploy an EC2 instance with Elastic File System (EFS) for shared storage. Demonstrate how multiple instances can access EFS concurrently.

### **Advanced Level**
10. **Multi-AZ and Cross-Region Auto Scaling**
    - Design a multi-AZ setup with cross-region auto-scaling to ensure high availability and disaster recovery for EC2 workloads.

11. **Automating EC2 Management with Systems Manager (SSM)**
    - Utilize AWS Systems Manager for automating EC2 management tasks, such as patching, software deployment, and inventory tracking.

12. **EC2 with AWS Lambda for Event-Driven Automation**
    - Automate EC2 actions using AWS Lambda functions and EventBridge. Trigger specific tasks based on EC2 state changes.

13. **Implementing EC2 with AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy to deploy applications on EC2 instances with version control and automation.

14. **Optimizing EC2 Costs with Reserved Instances and Savings Plans**
    - Analyze workload patterns, and set up Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to optimize long-term EC2 costs.

15. **Automated EC2 Backup and Recovery Strategy**
    - Implement an automated EC2 backup and recovery solution using AWS Backup and CloudFormation templates for quick recovery in case of failure.

16. **EC2 for Containerized Applications with ECS and Fargate**
    - Deploy containerized applications on EC2 using Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Fargate for serverless container orchestration.

17. **Building a Highly Available Web Application with EC2, RDS, and Route 53**
    - Deploy a multi-tier web application using EC2 for compute, RDS for database, and Route 53 for domain management and failover.

18. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture: On-Prem to EC2 VPN Setup**
    - Set up a secure VPN connection between on-premises infrastructure and AWS EC2 to create a hybrid cloud architecture.

### **Expert Level**
19. **EC2 Spot Fleet with Auto Scaling for Large-Scale Data Processing**
    - Implement a Spot Fleet with Auto Scaling for cost-effective and scalable data processing. Integrate S3 and DynamoDB for storage and tracking.

20. **EC2 with AWS ParallelCluster for HPC (High-Performance Computing)**
    - Set up an HPC environment using AWS ParallelCluster on EC2 instances for complex computational workloads.

These mini-projects will give hands-on experience with practical use cases, focusing on recent challenges and enterprise-grade solutions using EC2 and integrated services. Let me know when you're ready for more details on any specific project!
